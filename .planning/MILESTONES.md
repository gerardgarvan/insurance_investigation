## v1.4 AV+TH Subset Analysis (Shipped: 2026-04-27)

**Phases completed:** 1 phase (Phase 33), 2 plans, 2 tasks

**Delivered:** AV+TH-restricted multi-source overlap detection and classification scripts with preserved baseline outputs.

**Key accomplishments:**

- AV+TH multi-source overlap detection (R/33) with same-date and same-week encounter pair identification for outpatient encounters
- Identical/Partial/Distinct classification (R/34) for AV+TH multi-source encounters with per-site recommendations
- Established ENC_TYPE subset analysis pattern (clone-and-filter with `_av_th` suffix) reusable for future encounter type analyses
- 13/13 AVTH requirements completed (AVTH-DET-01 through 06, AVTH-CLS-01 through 07)

**Git range:** `e7d2af4..bca6819` (13 commits, 2026-04-23 to 2026-04-24)
**Code:** 1,242 LOC R (2 scripts: R/33_multi_source_overlap_av_th.R, R/34_overlap_classification_av_th.R)
